## code

- `jest.config.js`: use `ts-jest` to test TypeScript files; use mocks for imported CSS/LESS files; use TypeScript compiler to handle both TS/JS files
- `jest.setup.js`: use `enzyme` to test with [jQuery-like APIs](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme#readme)
- `tsconfig.jest.json`: allow JavaScript files (e.g., `jest.setup.js`) during the test
- `next.config.js`: just an ordinary Next.js config (with TypeScript and CSS support)
